Datatype :

	Catagories 
		
			Read only   
				Autonumber : 1CH -
				formula	 : A+B = C ==> 1+1 = C=>2 =>
				Rollup summary 
			
**************			
			Relationships
				
				Look up (1:n) : Linking 2 objects
				Master detail (1:n) : Parent to child relationship
								if record already existing ==> Lookup relationship=> populate parent records in loopup and save => convert to master detail
			
			
			
			Difference between Lookup & Master detail
			
					Lookup									Master detail
					--------								--------------
					Loose coupled                    		Tightly coupled
					Parent is independent					Parent is dependent
					Rollup summary can not be created		Rollup summary can be created(Parent Object)
					Record owner can be different			Owner for child record is same as parent record
					Cascade delete is not possible			Cascade delete is possible			
			
			
			Is it possible to change lookup to master details => Yes but if there is a records exisiting we need to populate values and save.
			Is it possible to change  master detail to lookup => Yes  but Rollup summery field should not be there
